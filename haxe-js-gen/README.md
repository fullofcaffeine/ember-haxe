TODO 

- QUESTION: `-js dummy.js`, Haxe expecs this, is there a way toa void this in a multi-file setup?
- TODO: Create a :ESREquire metatag, read it in the class generator to add the custom ES6 imports
- TODO: For Ember, each Haxe class should then be exported by default
- TODO: For Ember components, the class syntax generated is different. Probably an EmberClass metatag?
- TODO: For ember, js output files should be lowercase
- DOUBT: Different hxapp tree for Haxe files? Unless Ember conflicts with hx+js files sitting side by side


Notes:
- FLexibility: Bulk of the app in Haxe, but deviate where necessary (Pure ES6 or even TS)
